# Meeting Notes 

* Date: 2024.09.23
* Atendees: Andre, Caroline, Bert, Christine, Marc

## Future of the Data Catalog

KNMI responsibility in Ruisdael data management efforts?
* KDP is not publishing new datasets in KDP
* KNMI had budget allocated to data management

* KNMI could have the responsibility with some support from KNMI (Niels)

* Andre suggestion: A workgroup with individuals from different partern organization that meet once per month, to discuss tasks that need to be done and do them along that month. Include Niels and a researcher from TUD. Same goes for the website
   * easier for getting input from the partners (in shorter feedback loops)
   * Marc can comitt from TUD, but there is the need for more partner 


## Friday: Meeting with the Steering Comitte

Ulli + Arnoud: think the catalog is a good resource to have.
