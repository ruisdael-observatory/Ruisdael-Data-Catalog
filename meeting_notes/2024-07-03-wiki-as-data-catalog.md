[repo KDP]   -------indexed and described in ----> Ruisdael Data Catalog <--> PIs (writing metadata, )
[repo 4TU]                                                               <--> wiki admin

**Data(sets) Access:** 
* **public access** data repositories:  KDP, ICOS, 4TU , etc: wiki catalog entry link to dataset origin 
* **private access**: research drive, other, ... -> metadata -> wiki catalog entry points to contact PI/data-steward for requesting data

**Main Wiki enteties**
* Datasets
* Agent: people (ORCID records), organizations (ROR records) - 
* Sites
* Instruments



## the humans in the loop
How will PIs and researchers make use of the wiki:
* PIs/data-stewards will receive data requests and questions: they will need to respond to those  
* Fill in information on datasets

How to aid this process:
* write guidelines (documentation for PI) that explain how to contribute and interact with the system
