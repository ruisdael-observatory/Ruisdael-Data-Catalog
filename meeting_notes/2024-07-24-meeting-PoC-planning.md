# Meeting 2024-07-24 - Ruisdael Data Catalog & KDP
- date: 2024-07-24
- participantes: Mariska, Andre

## KDP tag Ruisdael
KDP has a the tag Ruisdael, under which we can find the datasets tagged as Ruisdael: https://dataplatform.knmi.nl/dataset/?tags=Ruisdael

Some of datasets "contain" both data (hosted by KDP) and metadata, or just metadata (example: [maq-observations-amsterdam-1-0](https://dataplatform.knmi.nl/dataset/maq-observations-amsterdam-1-0))
This almost makes it suitable for KDP(tag=Ruisdael) to constitude the Ruisdael Data Catalog.
However, the bottleneck, is that the process add a datasets to KDP, requires the review and entering the metadata, by KDP staff. That process has been slow.

Also there is the issue with DOIs that are not being minted by KDP

## added value to wiki catalog:
* users can enter information easily (not 3rd party needed)
* history of edits (can go back to previous versions of a page)
* dataset infomartion in interlinked, to Persons, Organizations, Data Services, and Campaigns
