Goals for Data Catalog
* dataset from dataset from all different data repositories
* show the potential and options that are available
* option to have data repository in their own bespoke environment - as long as dataset (source) has a refereable identifier (ie URL) we can link and described it the catalog.
* but also private datasets (no URLS, but contactPoint, PI, service (TUD project drive, iRods)
* link from Ruisdael website: information on data catalog and how it operates (WiP) -

# availability during summer

* Bert: July, September
* Caroline: from mid-August, September
* Andre: July, Andre, September
