# RDP preparation

## increase the number of datasets
start thinking of how we can increase the number of datasets in the catalog (Bert will be needs to do his part. I can also try to encourage Marc to include his datasets)
* Andre: send reminder email

## future of RDC
what will be the future of RDC after the presentation, if t, if the steering committee thinks the RDC wiki is a good approach that should keep being developed? We should think of questions and commitments to ask
* Marc suggestions: first see response and questions from presentation, based on that write questions to steering commitee 

## presentation planning 

Andre: (I want to have visual and text info on RDC data model)
